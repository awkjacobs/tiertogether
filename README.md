# tiertogether

tiertogether is a personal project that I started to track and rate movies that some friends and I viewed during a regular-ish movie night, but after a year of spending weekends and PTO days on development, this project has become an extended exercise to learn React and Next.js, in addition to continuing to learn Javascript.

> This project was never intended to earn any money, nor was it ever intended to be a commercial project. It is not monetized, and is not intended to be monetized.

## About Me

I am not a developer or engineer. I&apos;ve only been programming with Javascript since 2022, and this is my first large web project developed from scratch. As such, this project is sloppy and will most likely present bugs. I will continue to attempt to improve the site and add new features, but I don&apos;t intend to spend as much time working on it in the future as I did in the first year. You&apos;re welcome to view the source code here on GitHub, clone the project, or submit issues and pull requests!

More features are planned for the future, check out the [Roadmap](TODO.md#roadmap) for details.
